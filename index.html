    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">If I were to advise a client to secure their website from web security attacks, I would start with network security and tell them to include everyone in security practices in their company, by for instance suggesting a third-party authorization for them to use, to authenticate their user, this could be Okta for instance. Another important factor to look at is the clientâ€™s host, and the quality of the host. Since there are multiple different hosts to choose from, choosing a safe host is important and may not cost the company too much - but it would be a great deal if they do not prioritize their security. If my client were to have a website with login users and/or sensitive information regarding customers, I would advise them to have an automatic user timeout that would log the customer out if they were inactive for a period of time. Here I would advise them to have a short waiting time, no more than five minutes if the information is sensitive. Ensuring that the data system accepts the right format of the site is also important, and that the network security is of good quality to ensure that the information within the company and network is safe.  </p>
